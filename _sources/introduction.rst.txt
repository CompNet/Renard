Renard (Relationships Extraction from NARrative Documents) is a
character networks extraction pipeline written in Python. Character
networks are graphs where each node represent a character, and the
edges between nodes represent the relationship between two
characters. These networks have several possible applications:

- They allow intuitive visualisation of the relationships between
  characters in a story
- They can be used as an analysis tool
- They allow to encode the relationship between characters of a text
  in a single mathematical object

See LabatutAndBost2019_ for a more complete overview of character
networks and their automated extraction.
