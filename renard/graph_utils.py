#
# do as follow :
#
# writer = GEXFWriter(encoding=encoding, prettyprint=prettyprint, version=version)
# writer.add_graph(G)
#
# now before exporting, we can probably modify the graph. Of interest
# is probably to rename the id of "dweight" attribute (with title
# "dweight" but id "0") to "weight"
#
# and finally:
#
# writer.write()
#
# (or maybe we have to hack .write(), not sure)
