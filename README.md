Relationships Extraction from NARrative Documents


# Documentation

Documentation, including installation instructions, can be found at https://compnet.github.io/Renard/

If you need local documentation, it can be generated using `Sphinx`. From the `docs` directory, `make html` should create documentation under `docs/_build/html`. 


# Running tests 

Use the following command : ``poetry run python -m unittest discover ./tests``.
